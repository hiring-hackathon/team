### Lockfile for managing project dependencies

The `package-lock.json` file is an automatically generated file that ensures consistent dependency installations across different environments. It is created when you run `npm install` and is used to lock the versions of dependencies for the project named "team". This file includes metadata such as the lockfile version (3 in this case) and a flag indicating that dependencies are required. Although the `packages` section is currently empty, it will populate with detailed information about each installed package, including resolved versions, integrity checks, and dependency trees. This ensures that everyone working on the project has the same setup, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
