### JSON file containing comments metadata

This JSON file stores metadata for comments associated with various transcripts. Each comment includes details such as its unique identifier, text content, creation timestamp, and location within the transcript. The "Items" array holds multiple comment objects, each containing fields like "CommentId", "CommentText", "CreatedAt", "TranscriptId", and "Location". The "Location" field specifies the start and end indices of the comment within the transcript. The file also includes "Count" and "ScannedCount" fields, indicating the total number of comments present. This structure is useful for managing and querying comments in a transcript-based system.
