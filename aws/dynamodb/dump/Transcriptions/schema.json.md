### JSON schema for a DynamoDB table configuration

This JSON schema defines the configuration of a DynamoDB table named "Transcriptions." The table is structured to store transcription data, with "TranscriptId" as the primary key. The schema includes attribute definitions, key schema, table status, creation date, provisioned throughput settings, table size, item count, and table ARN. Additionally, it provides metadata about the response, including request ID, HTTP status code, headers, and retry attempts. This configuration ensures the table is set up with standard class settings and no deletion protection, making it suitable for managing transcription records efficiently.
