### Lambda function to update transcript text in DynamoDB

This code defines an AWS Lambda function that updates a transcript text in a DynamoDB table. It uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript, specifically the DynamoDB and DynamoDBDocumentClient classes, to interact with the DynamoDB service.

The function is designed to handle HTTP PUT requests. It extracts the `id` from the path parameters and the `transcriptText` from the request body. These values are used to construct an `UpdateCommand` that updates the `TranscriptText` attribute of an item in the `Transcriptions` table, identified by the `TranscriptId`.

Upon successful update, the function returns a 200 status code along with the updated attributes. If an error occurs, it catches the error, logs it, and returns a 500 status code with an error message. The function also sets CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests and specific HTTP methods and headers.
