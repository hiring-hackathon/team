### Lambda function to update and retrieve comments in DynamoDB

This code defines an AWS Lambda function that updates a comment in a DynamoDB table and retrieves the updated comment. The function is designed to handle HTTP requests, extracting the `commentId` and `transcriptId` from the path parameters and the updated comment fields from the request body. It uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with DynamoDB, specifically leveraging the `DynamoDBDocumentClient`, `UpdateCommand`, and `GetCommand` classes.

Upon receiving a request, the function constructs an update operation to modify the specified comment's text and location in the `Comments` table. After performing the update, it retrieves the updated comment to ensure all attributes, including any newly added ones, are returned in the response. The function handles errors gracefully, logging them and returning a 500 status code with an appropriate error message if any issues occur during the update or retrieval process. The response includes CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests.
