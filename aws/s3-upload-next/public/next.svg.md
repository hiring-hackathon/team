### SVG graphic for navigation and branding

This SVG file contains vector graphics representing navigation and branding elements. It includes paths that render text and shapes, forming a logo or icon. The file defines a scalable vector graphic with a viewBox of 394 by 80 units, ensuring it maintains its aspect ratio across different display sizes. The paths within the SVG are filled with black color (`#000`) and create various shapes and text elements, likely used for navigation buttons or branding purposes. The SVG format ensures that the graphic is resolution-independent, making it suitable for responsive web design.
