### SVG file rendering the Vercel logo

This SVG file defines the Vercel logo using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. The logo is composed of multiple path elements that outline the shapes and text of the Vercel brand. It includes a black fill color for the paths, ensuring the logo is rendered in black. The `viewBox` attribute sets the coordinate system for the SVG, and the `xmlns` attribute specifies the XML namespace for the SVG content. This file is typically used in web applications to display the Vercel logo in a scalable and resolution-independent manner.
