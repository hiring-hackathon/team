## [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json)

### TypeScript configuration for a Next.js project

This `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler options for a Next.js project. It specifies the environment libraries, such as `dom`, `dom.iterable`, and `esnext`, to ensure compatibility with modern JavaScript features and browser APIs. The `allowJs` option enables the inclusion of JavaScript files in the project, while `skipLibCheck` skips type checking of declaration files for faster compilation.

The `strict` option enforces strict type-checking rules, enhancing code quality and reducing potential runtime errors. The `noEmit` option prevents the compiler from generating output files, which is useful in a development environment where only type-checking is needed. The `esModuleInterop` setting allows for better compatibility with CommonJS modules.

The `module` and `moduleResolution` options are set to `esnext` and `bundler`, respectively, to align with modern module standards and bundling practices. The `resolveJsonModule` option allows importing JSON files as modules, and `isolatedModules` ensures that each file is treated as a separate module, which is beneficial for incremental builds.

The `jsx` option is set to `preserve`, meaning JSX syntax is left intact for further processing by tools like Babel. The `incremental` option enables incremental compilation, speeding up the build process by reusing information from previous compilations.

A plugin for Next.js is included to integrate with the framework's specific features. The `paths` option sets up an alias for the `src` directory, simplifying import statements.

The `include` array specifies the files and directories to be included in the compilation, covering TypeScript files, Next.js environment definitions, and type definitions. The `exclude` array ensures that `node_modules` are not included in the compilation process. The `typeRoots` option specifies directories containing type definitions, ensuring that both custom and third-party types are recognized by the compiler.
