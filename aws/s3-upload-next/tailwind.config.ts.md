### Tailwind CSS configuration for customizing content paths and theme extensions

This `tailwind.config.ts` file is a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The primary purpose of this file is to define the paths to all template files and extend the default theme with custom styles. The `content` array specifies the directories and file types that Tailwind CSS should scan for class names, ensuring that unused styles are purged in production. The `theme` section extends the default theme by adding custom background image utilities for radial and conic gradients, enhancing the design capabilities. The `plugins` array is currently empty but can be used to include additional Tailwind CSS plugins in the future. This configuration helps maintain a clean and efficient CSS output while allowing for custom design elements.
