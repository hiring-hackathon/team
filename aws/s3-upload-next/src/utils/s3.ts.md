### Utility functions for interacting with AWS S3

This file provides utility functions to interact with AWS S3, specifically for listing files in a bucket and generating presigned URLs for file uploads. It uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript to create an S3 client configured with credentials and region information from environment variables.

The `listFiles` function retrieves a list of files from a specified S3 bucket. It uses the `ListObjectsV2Command` to fetch the objects and filters out any entries without a defined key. If the bucket name is not provided, it throws an error.

The `getUploadUrl` function generates a presigned URL for uploading a file to S3. It takes a file name as input and creates a presigned post with conditions such as a maximum file size of 10 MB and an expiration time of 10 minutes. This function also throws an error if the bucket name is not defined.

Both functions include error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and ensure smooth operation.
