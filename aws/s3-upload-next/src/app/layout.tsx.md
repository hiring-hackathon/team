## [layout.tsx](layout.tsx)

### A layout component for a Next.js application with global styles and metadata.

This file defines a layout component for a Next.js application. It imports necessary types and functions from the Next.js framework, including metadata handling and Google Fonts integration. The `Inter` font from Google Fonts is imported and configured to support the Latin subset. Global CSS styles are also imported to ensure consistent styling across the application.

The `metadata` object sets the default title and description for the application, which helps with SEO and provides a better user experience.

The `RootLayout` component is a functional component that wraps the entire application. It accepts a `children` prop, which represents the nested components within the layout. The component returns an HTML structure with the language set to English and applies the `Inter` font class to the body element. This ensures that all child components inherit the global styles and font settings, providing a cohesive look and feel throughout the application.
