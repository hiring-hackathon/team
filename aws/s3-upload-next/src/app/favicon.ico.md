### Favicon.ico file containing binary data for a small icon image
The `favicon.ico` file is a binary file that contains the data for a small icon image, typically used by web browsers to display a site's icon in the address bar, tabs, and bookmarks. This file is in the ICO format, which supports multiple image sizes and color depths. The binary data in the file represents the pixel and color information for the icon. Since the file is binary, it is not human-readable and is meant to be interpreted by software that supports the ICO format. The file does not have any dependencies and is self-contained.
