### Configuration for PostCSS with Tailwind CSS plugin

This file configures PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. The configuration specifies the use of the Tailwind CSS plugin, which is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. By exporting this configuration, PostCSS can automatically load and apply the Tailwind CSS plugin during the build process. This setup is essential for projects that leverage Tailwind CSS to ensure that the styles are processed correctly and efficiently.
