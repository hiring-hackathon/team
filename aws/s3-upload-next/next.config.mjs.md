## [next.config.mjs](next.config.mjs)

### Minimal Next.js configuration file

The `next.config.mjs` file is a minimal configuration setup for a Next.js project. It exports an empty configuration object, which means the project is using the default settings provided by Next.js. This file is essential for customizing various aspects of a Next.js application, such as routing, webpack configurations, and environment variables. However, in its current state, it does not modify any default behavior, making it a good starting point for further customization as the project evolves. This setup ensures that new team members can quickly understand and extend the configuration as needed.
