## [package.json](package.json)

### A package.json file for a Lambda function with dependencies on axios and openai.

This `package.json` file defines the configuration for a Node.js project named "my-lambda-function". The project is at version 1.0.0 and is set up as an ECMAScript module (`type: "module"`). The main entry point for the application is `index.js`.

The project has two dependencies:
- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
- `openai`: A client library for interacting with OpenAI's API.

The `scripts` section includes a placeholder for running tests, which currently outputs an error message indicating that no tests are specified. The file also includes metadata fields such as `keywords`, `author`, `license`, and `description`, which are currently empty but can be filled in to provide more context about the project.
