### Lambda function for summarizing text using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model

This code defines an AWS Lambda function that processes incoming events to summarize text using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The function begins by importing necessary modules, including `axios` for potential HTTP requests and `OpenAI` for interacting with the OpenAI API. It initializes the OpenAI client with an API key sourced from environment variables.

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `handler` function, which is designed to handle events triggered by AWS services such as API Gateway or direct Lambda invocations. The function logs the incoming event and its body for debugging purposes. It then parses the event body to extract the text that needs summarizing.

If the text to be summarized is not provided, the function throws an error. Otherwise, it constructs a request to the OpenAI API, asking it to summarize the provided text. The request specifies the use of the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model and includes a system message to instruct the model to act as a helpful assistant.

Upon receiving a response from OpenAI, the function extracts the summary from the API's response and logs it. Finally, it returns a successful HTTP response containing the summary. If any errors occur during the process, the function catches them, logs the error, and returns a 500 HTTP response with an error message. This setup ensures that the function can handle various types of invocation events and provides a robust mechanism for summarizing text using advanced AI capabilities.
