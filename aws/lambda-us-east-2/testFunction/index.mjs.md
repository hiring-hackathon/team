### Asynchronous Lambda function handler returning the event body

This code defines an asynchronous Lambda function handler in JavaScript (ES6 module syntax). The handler function takes an `event` object as its parameter and constructs a response object with a `statusCode` of 200, indicating a successful request. The `body` of the response is set to the JSON stringified version of the `event.body`, which means it returns the body of the incoming event in the response. This setup is useful for debugging or echoing back the received data, making it easier to understand what data the Lambda function is receiving. The function then returns this response object. This code does not rely on any external dependencies, making it lightweight and straightforward to deploy in a serverless environment.
