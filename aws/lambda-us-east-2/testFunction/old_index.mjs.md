### Simple AWS Lambda handler returning the event data

This code defines an asynchronous AWS Lambda handler function that processes incoming events. When triggered, the handler function constructs a response object with a status code of 200, indicating a successful execution. The response body is set to the event data received by the Lambda function. This setup allows the function to echo back the event data, which can be useful for debugging or initial testing purposes. The code includes commented-out lines that suggest alternative response bodies, such as a static message or the stringified event data, but these are not currently active. This basic structure provides a foundation for further development and customization of the Lambda function's behavior.
