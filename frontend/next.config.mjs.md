### Minimal Next.js configuration file

This `next.config.mjs` file is a minimal configuration setup for a Next.js project. It defines an empty configuration object, `nextConfig`, which is then exported as the default export of the module. The file uses the JSDoc type annotation to specify that `nextConfig` should conform to the `NextConfig` type from the Next.js library. This setup serves as a starting point for further customization and configuration of the Next.js application, allowing developers to easily add or modify settings as needed.
