## [vercel.svg](vercel.svg)

### SVG file rendering Vercel logo and text

This SVG file defines a scalable vector graphic that renders the Vercel logo along with some stylized text. The SVG uses the `<path>` element to draw complex shapes and text, with specific coordinates and commands to create the desired visual representation. The `fill` attribute is set to "black" to color the paths, and the `viewBox` attribute ensures the graphic scales correctly within a defined viewport. This file is typically used to display the Vercel logo in web applications or documentation, ensuring a crisp and scalable image that maintains quality at various sizes.
