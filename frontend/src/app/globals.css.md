### Global CSS configuration for a Tailwind CSS project

This `globals.css` file sets up the foundational styles for a project using Tailwind CSS. It imports the base, components, and utilities layers from Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the project's styling adheres to Tailwind's utility-first approach. 

The file defines a series of CSS custom properties (variables) within the `:root` selector, which are used to standardize colors, spacing, and other design tokens across the application. These variables include settings for background, foreground, card, popover, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive colors, border, input, ring, radius, and chart colors. These variables help maintain a consistent design language throughout the project.

Additionally, the file applies some global styles using the `@layer base` directive. It sets a default border color for all elements and applies background and text color styles to the `body` element. 

The `@layer components` directive is used to define reusable component styles. For example, the `.layout-container` class applies container, padding, margin, and maximum width styles, while the `.page-container` class sets up a flexible layout with specific padding and gap settings, inheriting styles from `.layout-container`.

Overall, this `globals.css` file establishes a cohesive and maintainable styling foundation for the project, leveraging Tailwind CSS's powerful utility classes and custom properties.
