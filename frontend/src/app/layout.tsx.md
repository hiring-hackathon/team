### RootLayout component for Next.js with PostHog analytics and Inter font integration

The `layout.tsx` file defines the `RootLayout` component for a Next.js application. This component serves as the foundational layout for the application, wrapping all child components with essential configurations and providers.

Firstly, the file imports necessary modules and types, including the `Metadata` type from Next.js, the Inter font from Google Fonts, and a custom PostHog provider from `providers.tsx`. The Inter font is imported and configured to support the Latin subset, ensuring consistent typography across the application.

The `metadata` object is defined to set the title and description of the application, which are used for SEO and browser tab information.

The `RootLayout` component itself is a functional component that takes `children` as a prop. This prop represents the nested components that will be rendered within this layout. The component returns an HTML structure where the language is set to English (`lang="en"`). The `CSPostHogProvider` wraps the `body` element, enabling PostHog analytics throughout the application. This setup allows for tracking user interactions and behaviors, providing valuable insights for improving user experience and application performance.

The `body` element applies the Inter font class to ensure consistent styling and renders the `children` components passed to `RootLayout`. This structure ensures that all pages and components within the application benefit from the same layout, font styling, and analytics tracking.

## [providers.tsx](providers.tsx)

### Client-side PostHog analytics integration for React components

This file, `providers.tsx`, is designed to integrate PostHog analytics into a Next.js application on the client side. It initializes the PostHog client using environment variables for the API key and host, ensuring that analytics data is sent to the correct PostHog instance. The `CSPostHogProvider` component wraps its children with the `PostHogProvider` from the `posthog-js/react` library, enabling any nested components to access and utilize PostHog's analytics features. This setup is essential for tracking user interactions and behaviors within the application, providing valuable insights for improving user experience and application performance.
