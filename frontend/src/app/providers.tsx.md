### Client-side PostHog analytics provider for Next.js application

This file defines a client-side component for integrating PostHog analytics into a Next.js application. It uses the `posthog-js` library to initialize PostHog on the client side, ensuring that analytics data is correctly captured and sent to the PostHog server. The initialization is conditional, checking if the code is running in a browser environment (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`). The `CSPostHogProvider` component wraps its children with the `PostHogProvider` from `posthog-js/react`, passing the initialized PostHog client. This setup allows any child components to access and use PostHog for analytics purposes, facilitating user behavior tracking and event logging within the application.
