### Smart summary generator for conversations

This TypeScript file defines a POST route for a Next.js serverless function that generates concise summaries of conversations using OpenAI's API. The code initializes the OpenAI client with a specific base URL and API key, and sets up a system message to instruct the AI to act as a smart summary generator. When a POST request is received, the function extracts the prompt and transcripts from the request body, logs them, and sends a request to OpenAI's chat completion endpoint. The AI model used is 'meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free'. The response from OpenAI is processed to extract the generated summary, which is then returned as a JSON response. If an error occurs during this process, a detailed error message is logged and a JSON error response is returned with a 500 status code. This functionality is useful for creating automated summaries of conversation data, making it easier to digest and review large amounts of text.
