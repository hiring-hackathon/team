### A simple page displaying a list of transcripts with a navbar and footer.

This file defines a React functional component named `Page` that serves as a layout for displaying a list of transcripts. The component utilizes three main subcomponents: `Navbar`, `TranscriptList`, and `Footer`. The `Navbar` is positioned at the top of the page, providing navigation options. The main content area is centered and styled to be responsive, containing a heading and the `TranscriptList` component, which presumably displays a list of transcript items. Finally, the `Footer` component is placed at the bottom of the page. The entire layout is designed to be flexible and occupy the full height of the viewport, ensuring that the footer remains at the bottom even if the content is minimal. This structure provides a clean and organized user interface for viewing transcripts.
