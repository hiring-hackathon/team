### AI-powered chatbot interface with voice recognition

This file defines a React component for an AI-powered chatbot interface. The component uses state hooks to manage messages, user input, and voice recognition status. It initializes speech recognition capabilities using the Web Speech API, allowing users to input messages via voice. The chatbot interface includes a text input field, a send button, and a voice input toggle button. Messages are displayed in a styled chat window, with different styles for user and assistant messages. The component also handles sending messages to an API endpoint and updating the chat window with responses. The layout is enhanced with a navigation bar and footer for a complete user experience.
