### A simple landing page with a navbar, features section, and footer.

This file defines a React component for the home page of a web application. It imports several components, including a `Navbar`, `Footer`, and `Features` section, which are used to structure the page. The `Home` component returns a JSX layout that includes these components within a flex container to ensure proper alignment and spacing. The `Navbar` is placed at the top, followed by a main content area that houses the `Features` section, and finally, the `Footer` at the bottom. There is also a commented-out section for a "List" button that links to a `/transcripts` page, which can be enabled if needed. This setup provides a clean and organized structure for the landing page, making it easy to navigate and extend.
