## [footer.tsx](footer.tsx)

### Footer component for displaying social media links and current year
The `footer.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `Footer`. This component is responsible for rendering a footer section on a webpage. The footer includes the current year and a set of social media icons with links to various platforms such as Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, and GitHub. The current year is dynamically generated using JavaScript's `Date` object. The social media icons are imported from the `lucide-react` library, which provides SVG icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube. The footer is styled with Tailwind CSS classes to ensure a consistent and responsive design. Each social media link opens in a new tab and includes accessibility features such as `aria-label` attributes for better screen reader support. This component is designed to be easily integrated into any React application to provide a consistent footer with social media connectivity.
