### Responsive navigation bar with dynamic menu toggle

This `nav.tsx` file defines a responsive navigation bar component for a React application. The component, `Navbar`, uses the `useState` hook to manage the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens. It imports the `Button` component from a local UI library and the `Menu` and `X` icons from the `lucide-react` library to toggle the menu's visibility.

The navigation bar includes links to different sections of the application, such as "Team", "Transcripts", "Files", and "Chat". These links are dynamically generated from an array of objects, each containing a title and a path. The component uses conditional rendering to display either the `Menu` or `X` icon based on the current state, allowing users to open or close the menu on mobile devices.

The navigation bar is styled to be fully responsive, adjusting its layout based on the screen size. On larger screens, the navigation links are displayed horizontally, while on smaller screens, they are hidden behind a toggleable menu. This ensures a seamless user experience across different devices.
