## [comments.tsx](comments.tsx)

### Fetches and displays comments for a given transcript

This file defines a React component named `CommentSection` that fetches and displays comments associated with a specific transcript. The component takes a `transcriptId` as a prop and uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage and fetch the comments, respectively. Upon mounting, it makes an asynchronous API call to retrieve comments related to the provided `transcriptId`. The fetched comments are then stored in the component's state. The component renders a list of comments, displaying the timestamp and text of each comment. If a comment includes a file URL, it provides a link to the attached file. If no comments are available, it displays a message indicating that there are no comments yet.
