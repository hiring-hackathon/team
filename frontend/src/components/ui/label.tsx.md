### A customizable and accessible label component for React applications

This code defines a React component named `Label` that serves as a customizable and accessible label element. It leverages the `@radix-ui/react-label` package to ensure accessibility and semantic correctness. The `Label` component uses the `class-variance-authority` (CVA) library to manage and apply consistent styling variants, which include text size, font weight, and handling of disabled states. The `cn` utility function is used to concatenate class names dynamically. The component is created using `React.forwardRef` to allow for ref forwarding, making it easier to integrate with other form elements. The `Label` component is designed to be flexible and reusable, providing a standardized way to implement label elements across the application.
