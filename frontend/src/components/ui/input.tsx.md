### Simple and customizable input component for React applications

This code defines a reusable and customizable input component for React applications. The `Input` component is created using the `React.forwardRef` function, allowing it to accept a ref that can be forwarded to the underlying `<input>` element. The component extends the standard HTML input attributes through the `InputProps` interface, making it flexible and easy to integrate into various forms and user interfaces.

The `Input` component applies a set of default CSS classes to style the input field, ensuring a consistent appearance across the application. These styles include properties for dimensions, border, background, padding, text size, and focus states. The `cn` utility function is used to conditionally merge additional class names passed via the `className` prop, allowing further customization.

The component also handles various states such as focus, disabled, and placeholder text, enhancing the user experience. By exporting the `Input` component, it can be imported and used in other parts of the application, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
