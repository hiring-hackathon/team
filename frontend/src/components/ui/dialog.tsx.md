### A set of components for creating customizable dialog modals using Radix UI and React.

This file defines a collection of React components that facilitate the creation of dialog modals with customizable content and behavior. Utilizing the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` library, it provides a structured and accessible way to implement dialog boxes in a React application. The main components include `Dialog`, `DialogTrigger`, `DialogPortal`, `DialogOverlay`, `DialogContent`, `DialogClose`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogTitle`, and `DialogDescription`.

- `Dialog` serves as the root component for the dialog modal.
- `DialogTrigger` is used to open the dialog.
- `DialogPortal` ensures that the dialog is rendered in a specific part of the DOM.
- `DialogOverlay` provides a semi-transparent background overlay that appears behind the dialog content.
- `DialogContent` is the main container for the dialog's content, including animations for opening and closing states.
- `DialogClose` is a button to close the dialog, featuring an icon and accessibility enhancements.
- `DialogHeader` and `DialogFooter` are layout components for structuring the dialog's header and footer sections.
- `DialogTitle` and `DialogDescription` are used to provide a title and description for the dialog, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

These components are designed to be flexible and easily styled, making it straightforward to integrate dialog modals into various parts of a React application. The use of `React.forwardRef` and `className` props allows for further customization and styling.
