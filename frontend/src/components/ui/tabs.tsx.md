### A set of React components for creating tabbed interfaces using Radix UI primitives.

This file defines a set of React components to create a tabbed interface using the Radix UI Tabs primitives. The `Tabs` component serves as the root container for the tabbed interface. The `TabsList` component is a wrapper for the list of tab triggers, styled to be horizontally aligned and responsive. The `TabsTrigger` component represents individual tab buttons that users can click to switch between different tab panels. The `TabsContent` component is used to display the content associated with each tab. Each component is built using `React.forwardRef` to allow for flexible ref forwarding and is styled using a utility function `cn` for conditional class names. These components are designed to be accessible and responsive, with focus and active state styles to enhance user experience.
