### Reusable React components for creating a card UI

This file defines a set of reusable React components to construct a card user interface. The components include `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter`. Each component is built using the `React.forwardRef` function, allowing them to accept a `ref` prop for direct manipulation of the DOM elements. 

The `Card` component serves as the main container with a rounded border, background color, and shadow. The `CardHeader` component is designed for the top section of the card, typically containing the title and other header elements. The `CardTitle` component is a styled heading, while the `CardDescription` component provides a smaller, muted text for additional information. The `CardContent` component is intended for the main content area of the card, and the `CardFooter` component is for the bottom section, often used for actions or additional details.

Each component uses a utility function `cn` to concatenate class names, allowing for flexible styling through additional `className` props. This modular approach enables developers to easily compose and customize card layouts in their applications.
