## [features.tsx](features.tsx)

### A React component showcasing key features of an application in a visually appealing layout.

The `Features` component is a React functional component designed to display a list of key features of an application. It uses JSX to structure the content and applies various CSS classes for styling. The component is wrapped in a `div` with padding and contains a title "Features" styled with a bold, yellow font. Below the title, there are three feature descriptions, each enclosed in a styled `div` with padding, background color, rounded corners, and shadow effects.

Each feature is presented with a title and a brief description. The features highlighted include:

1. **Realtime Transcript Editing**: An intuitive interface for browsing, viewing, and navigating transcripts with search functionality and text highlighting.
2. **Interactive Commenting System**: A robust system allowing users to add, edit, or delete comments on specific transcript sections, facilitating collaboration.
3. **LLM-Powered Transcript and Comment Processing**: Utilizes a Large Language Model to analyze and process transcripts and comments, offering summaries, sentiment detection, insights, and recommendations.

The layout is responsive, using flexbox to arrange the feature descriptions in a flexible, gap-filled manner, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing presentation.
