### Interactive team member showcase with email copy functionality

This code defines a React component named `MeetTheTeam` that displays a list of team members with their details, including name, role, photo, email, and location. The component uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage and display a toast notification when a user's email address is copied to the clipboard. Each team member's information is rendered in a responsive grid layout, and a button is provided to copy the email address to the clipboard. When the button is clicked, the email address is copied, and a toast notification appears to confirm the action. The notification automatically disappears after three seconds. The component leverages the `Image` component from `next/image` for optimized image rendering and a custom `Button` component for consistent styling.
