## [tailwind.config.ts](tailwind.config.ts)

### Tailwind CSS configuration file for customizing themes and animations

This `tailwind.config.ts` file is a configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It customizes various aspects of the Tailwind setup to fit the specific needs of the project.

The `darkMode` option is set to "class", enabling dark mode based on a CSS class. The `content` array specifies the paths to all template files where Tailwind CSS classes will be applied, ensuring unused styles are purged in production.

The `theme` section extends the default Tailwind theme. It centers the container and adds padding, with specific settings for larger screens. Custom color schemes are defined using CSS variables, allowing for dynamic theming. These include primary, secondary, destructive, muted, accent, popover, and card colors, each with default and foreground variations.

Border radii are customized with CSS variables, providing consistent styling across the application. Custom keyframes and animations are defined for accordion components, enhancing user interactions with smooth transitions.

Finally, the configuration includes the `tailwindcss-animate` plugin, which adds additional animation utilities to the project. This setup ensures a highly customizable and maintainable design system tailored to the project's requirements.
