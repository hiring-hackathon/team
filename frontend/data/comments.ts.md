## [comments.ts](comments.ts)

### Array of comment objects for call transcripts

This file defines an array of comment objects, each representing feedback on specific call transcripts. Each comment object contains an `id`, `transcriptId`, `text`, `fileUrl`, and `timestamp`. The `id` uniquely identifies the comment, while `transcriptId` links the comment to a specific call transcript. The `text` field provides the actual feedback, which can range from suggestions for improvement to positive remarks. The `fileUrl` field can optionally include a link to an associated file, such as a PDF, for additional context. The `timestamp` records the exact time the comment was made. This structure is useful for organizing and retrieving feedback related to customer service calls, enabling better analysis and training.
