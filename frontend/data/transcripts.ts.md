## [transcripts.ts](transcripts.ts)

### A collection of customer service call transcripts with timestamps.

The `transcripts.ts` file contains an array of objects representing a series of customer service call transcripts. Each object in the array includes an `id`, `text`, and `timestamp`. The `id` is a unique identifier for each transcript, the `text` contains the dialogue of the call, and the `timestamp` records the exact time the dialogue took place. This data structure is useful for storing and retrieving detailed records of customer interactions, which can be used for training, quality assurance, or analysis purposes. The transcripts cover a complete conversation between a customer and a service representative, addressing issues such as account balance discrepancies and introducing new service offerings.
