### Configuration file for PostCSS with Tailwind CSS plugin

This file configures PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. The configuration specifies that the Tailwind CSS plugin should be used. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. The configuration is exported as the default export, making it available for use in the build process. This setup allows for the integration of Tailwind CSS into the project's CSS workflow, enabling the use of its utility classes throughout the project's stylesheets.
