### TypeScript configuration for a Next.js project with strict type-checking and modern JavaScript features.

This `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler for a Next.js project. It specifies various compiler options to enhance the development experience and ensure code quality. The `lib` option includes modern JavaScript and DOM libraries, enabling the use of the latest features. `allowJs` allows JavaScript files to be compiled, while `skipLibCheck` skips type checking of declaration files for faster builds. The `strict` option enforces strict type-checking rules, improving code reliability.

The `noEmit` option prevents the compiler from emitting JavaScript files, useful in a build process managed by Next.js. `esModuleInterop` and `moduleResolution` settings ensure compatibility with ES modules and bundler-based module resolution. The `resolveJsonModule` option allows importing JSON files as modules, and `isolatedModules` ensures each file is treated as a separate module for faster incremental builds. The `jsx` setting preserves JSX syntax for further processing by Next.js.

The `incremental` option enables faster subsequent builds by storing information about previous compilations. The `plugins` section includes a Next.js-specific plugin to enhance the development experience. The `paths` option sets up module resolution aliases, simplifying imports from the `src` directory.

The `include` array specifies the files and directories to be included in the compilation, covering TypeScript and JavaScript files relevant to the project. The `exclude` array ensures that `node_modules` are not included in the compilation, preventing unnecessary processing of external dependencies.
