### Configuration for UI components with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

This `components.json` file configures the UI components for a project using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. It specifies the schema URL for validation, sets the style to "default", and enables support for React Server Components (RSC) and TypeScript (TSX). The Tailwind CSS configuration includes paths to the Tailwind config file and global CSS file, sets the base color to "neutral", enables CSS variables, and allows for an optional prefix. Additionally, it defines path aliases for easier imports, mapping "components" to "@/components" and "utils" to "@/lib/utils". This setup streamlines the development process by providing a structured and customizable environment for building UI components.
