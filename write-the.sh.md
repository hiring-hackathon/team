## [write-the.sh](write-the.sh)

### Automates documentation generation for all directories in the current directory.

This script is designed to automate the process of generating documentation for all directories within the current directory, excluding hidden directories. It uses the `write-the` command-line tool to create and save documentation for each directory it finds. The script begins by searching for all directories that are not hidden (i.e., those that do not have a path containing `*/.*`). For each directory found, it runs the `write-the docs --save` command, which generates and saves the documentation for that directory. This script is useful for maintaining up-to-date documentation across multiple directories in a project, ensuring that all parts of the project are well-documented without manual intervention.
