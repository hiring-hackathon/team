### React-based API Interaction for Transcription Management

This code provides a set of React components for interacting with a transcription management API. It includes functionalities for fetching all transcriptions, fetching a single transcription by ID, creating a new transcription, updating an existing transcription, and deleting a transcription. Additionally, it supports fetching, creating, updating, and deleting comments associated with transcriptions. Each component uses React hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` to manage API calls and state. The API endpoints are accessed via HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and the results are logged to the console or displayed within the application. The code is designed to be modular, with each functionality encapsulated in its own component, making it easy to maintain and extend.
