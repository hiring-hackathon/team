## [LICENSE](LICENSE)

### Summary
The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) ensures software freedom, especially for network server software, by mandating source code availability.

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) Version 3 is a free, copyleft license designed to ensure that software remains free and open for all users, particularly in the context of network server software. It allows users to freely share, modify, and distribute software, provided that the source code of any modified version is made available to the community. This license aims to protect users' freedom by preventing the privatization of improvements made to the software, especially when it is used on network servers. The AGPL mandates that if a modified version of the software is run on a publicly accessible server, the source code must be provided to the users of that server. This ensures that the benefits of modifications are shared with the community. The license also includes provisions for protecting users' legal rights, handling patents, and ensuring that additional terms do not impose further restrictions on the granted freedoms. The AGPL is designed to promote cooperation and sharing within the software community, ensuring that software remains free and open for all its users.
