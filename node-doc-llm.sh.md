## [node-doc-llm.sh](node-doc-llm.sh)

### Automates documentation generation for project files using a Node.js script

This script is designed to automate the generation of documentation for various project files using a Node.js-based documentation tool. Initially, it navigates into the `node-doc-llm` directory, which is presumably a cloned repository containing the necessary documentation generation tools. The script then installs the required Node.js dependencies using `npm i`.

Once the setup is complete, the script iterates over all files in the parent directory, excluding hidden files and directories. For each file found, it invokes a Node.js script (`index.js`) to generate corresponding markdown documentation files. The generated documentation files are saved with the same name as the original files but with an added `.md` extension. This process ensures that every file in the project has an associated markdown documentation file, facilitating easier project understanding and maintenance.
