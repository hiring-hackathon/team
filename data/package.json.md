### React-based transcription application setup with testing and build scripts

This `package.json` file defines the setup for a React-based transcription application named "transcription-app". The project is currently at version 0.1.0 and is marked as private, meaning it is not intended for public distribution.

The dependencies include essential libraries for building and testing React applications:
- `react` and `react-dom` for building user interfaces.
- `react-scripts` for managing the build and development processes.
- `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `@testing-library/user-event` for testing the application.
- `web-vitals` for measuring performance metrics.

The `scripts` section provides commands to start the development server, build the application for production, run tests, and eject the configuration if needed. The ESLint configuration extends standard React and Jest rules to ensure code quality and consistency. The `browserslist` configuration specifies the target browsers for both production and development environments, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across different browsers.
