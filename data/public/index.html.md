### HTML template for a React application

This `index.html` file serves as the main HTML template for a React application created using `create-react-app`. It includes essential meta tags for character encoding, viewport settings, theme color, and a description of the web application. The file references a favicon and an Apple touch icon, both located in the `public` folder, and includes a link to a `manifest.json` file, which provides metadata for when the web app is installed on a user's device.

The HTML file contains a `div` with the id `root`, which is the mounting point for the React application. A `noscript` tag is included to prompt users to enable JavaScript if it is disabled. The comments within the file provide guidance on how to use the template, including instructions for adding web fonts, meta tags, or analytics, and details on how the build process will handle the bundled scripts. The file is designed to work seamlessly with client-side routing and non-root public URLs.
