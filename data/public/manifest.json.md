## [manifest.json](manifest.json)

### Web app manifest for a React application

The `manifest.json` file is a crucial part of a Progressive Web App (PWA) setup for a React application. It provides metadata about the app, which is used by the browser to enhance the user experience. The `short_name` and `name` fields specify the app's short and full names, respectively. The `icons` array includes different icon files with various sizes and types, ensuring the app looks good on different devices and screen resolutions. The `start_url` defines the URL that the app should load when launched. The `display` property is set to "standalone," which allows the app to be displayed in a standalone window, similar to a native app. The `theme_color` and `background_color` properties define the primary theme color and the background color of the app, respectively, providing a consistent look and feel. This manifest file helps in making the React application more user-friendly and accessible when installed on a user's device.
