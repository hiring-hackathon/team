## [robots.txt](robots.txt)

### A simple robots.txt file allowing all web crawlers to access the entire site

The `robots.txt` file provided is a basic configuration for controlling web crawler access to a website. It follows the standard defined by the Robots Exclusion Protocol. The file specifies that all user agents (web crawlers) are allowed to access all parts of the site without any restrictions. This is indicated by the `User-agent: *` directive, which applies to all crawlers, and the `Disallow:` directive, which is left empty, meaning no URLs are disallowed. This setup is useful for ensuring that search engines and other web crawlers can freely index the entire site.
