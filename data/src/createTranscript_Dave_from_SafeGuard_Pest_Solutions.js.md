### React component for posting a transcript to an API and displaying the response

This code defines a React component that automates the process of posting a predefined transcript to an API endpoint and displaying the response. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. Upon mounting, the component sends a POST request containing the transcript text to a specified API endpoint. The response from the API is then displayed on the page. The component also handles loading states and potential errors during the API call. Users can manually trigger the API call by clicking a button, which is disabled while the request is in progress. The UI includes sections for displaying the transcript, the API response, and any errors that occur.
