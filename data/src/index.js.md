### Entry point for a React application with performance monitoring

This code serves as the entry point for a React application. It imports necessary modules, including React, ReactDOM, a CSS file for styling, the main `App` component, and a utility for reporting web performance metrics (`reportWebVitals`). The `ReactDOM.createRoot` method is used to create a root DOM node where the React component tree will be rendered. The `App` component is then rendered inside a `React.StrictMode` wrapper, which helps identify potential problems in the application by activating additional checks and warnings.

Additionally, the `reportWebVitals` function is called to start measuring and reporting key web performance metrics. This function can be customized to log results or send them to an analytics endpoint, providing insights into the application's performance. This setup ensures that the application is both robust and performance-aware from the start.


## [App.js](App.js)

### React component for posting and displaying a transcript with error handling

This code defines a React component named `App` that handles the posting of a predefined transcript to a remote server and displays the result. The component uses React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects. It initializes three state variables: `response` to store the server's response, `error` to capture any errors during the request, and `loading` to indicate the loading state.

The `transcriptText` variable contains a lengthy conversation transcript. The `postTranscript` function is an asynchronous function that sends a POST request with the transcript to a specified API endpoint. It updates the state based on the success or failure of the request.

The `useEffect` hook triggers the `postTranscript` function when the component mounts. The component's JSX structure includes a header, a section to display the transcript, a button to manually trigger the posting of the transcript, and conditional rendering to show loading status, errors, or the server's response.

The component is styled using inline styles to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface. The button is disabled during the loading state to prevent multiple submissions. Error messages and responses are displayed in styled containers to enhance user experience.


## [reportWebVitals.js](reportWebVitals.js)

### Utility to measure and report web performance metrics

The `reportWebVitals.js` file defines a function named `reportWebVitals` that is used to measure and report key web performance metrics. The function takes a single argument, `onPerfEntry`, which is expected to be a callback function. If `onPerfEntry` is provided and is a function, the code dynamically imports the `web-vitals` library. Once the library is loaded, it retrieves several performance measurement functions: `getCLS`, `getFID`, `getFCP`, `getLCP`, and `getTTFB`. These functions are then called with `onPerfEntry` as their argument, enabling the collection and reporting of metrics such as Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), First Input Delay (FID), First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Time to First Byte (TTFB). This setup allows developers to monitor and analyze the performance of their web applications effectively.
