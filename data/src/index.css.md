### CSS for basic styling and font settings

The `index.css` file provides foundational styling for a web application. It sets the default margin for the `body` element to zero, ensuring that the content spans the entire viewport without any unintended spacing. The `font-family` property for the `body` is defined using a stack of system and web-safe fonts, ensuring a consistent and readable appearance across different platforms and devices. Additionally, it includes properties for font smoothing to enhance text rendering on both macOS and Windows systems.

For code elements, the `font-family` is set to a stack of monospaced fonts, which are typically used for displaying code snippets. This ensures that code is displayed in a clear and readable manner, maintaining the alignment and spacing that is crucial for code readability. The chosen fonts are widely supported and provide a consistent look across various environments.
