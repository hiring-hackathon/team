### Simple test to check if the "learn react" link is rendered

This test file, `App.test.js`, is designed to verify that the `App` component renders correctly by checking for the presence of a specific text element. It uses the `@testing-library/react` library to render the `App` component and then queries the rendered output for an element containing the text "learn react". The test asserts that this element is present in the document, ensuring that the `App` component includes the expected content. This basic test helps confirm that the initial rendering of the `App` component is functioning as intended.

### React component for posting and displaying a transcript

This `App.js` file defines a React component that handles the posting of a predefined transcript to an API endpoint and displays the response. The component uses React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects. Upon mounting, the component automatically posts the transcript to the specified API endpoint using the `postTranscript` function, which handles the API call and updates the state based on the response. The UI includes a button to manually trigger the posting of the transcript, and it conditionally renders loading indicators, error messages, and the API response. The transcript is displayed in a styled container, and the component ensures a user-friendly experience with clear feedback during the posting process.
