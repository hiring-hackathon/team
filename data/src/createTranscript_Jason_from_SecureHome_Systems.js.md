### A React component for posting and displaying a sales call transcript.

This code defines a React component that handles the posting and display of a sales call transcript. The component uses React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects. Initially, it sets up state variables for the response, error, and loading status. The transcript text is hardcoded within the component.

Upon mounting, the `useEffect` hook triggers the `postTranscript` function, which sends the transcript text to a specified API endpoint using a POST request. The function handles loading states and potential errors, updating the state accordingly based on the API response.

The component renders the transcript text, a button to manually trigger the posting of the transcript, and conditional messages based on the loading, error, and response states. The button is disabled while the transcript is being posted, and appropriate messages or error details are displayed based on the state of the request.
