"1724553817558-9497","""Michael is one of the founders of a company called Rela, where he serves as the Chief AI Officer. Rela provides speech analytics for outside sales, analyzing conversations to help sales reps sell more effectively. Michael got into AI somewhat unexpectedly - he was originally studying electrical engineering in college but was struggling academically. After watching the TV show Westworld, he became fascinated with AI and started teaching himself Python and machine learning concepts through online resources.\n\nAs a senior in college, Michael created a music recommendation system that used AI to analyze the actual content of songs, rather than just collaborative filtering. He entered this project into competitions and hackathons, which led to some exciting opportunities. At one event, he ended up presenting to high-profile judges like Jack Selby (PayPal co-founder) and even got connected with Apple Music executives.\n\nMichael emphasized that he had no formal training in AI or computer science. He learned through grinding - watching tutorials, implementing papers, and working on projects. When starting Rela, he spent two years solving the challenging problem of speaker diarization (determining who is speaking and when in an audio recording). Michael values creativity and out-of-the-box thinking when hiring, as the problems they tackle often have no existing solutions.\n\nThe video concluded with a demonstration of an AI-powered accountability coach that Headstarter is developing. It uses conversational AI to check in on users' job search progress, learning goals, and overall wellbeing. Michael was impressed by the speed and capabilities of the system, which the Headstarter team revealed is running on the newly released Llama 3 model."""

Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

Am I speaking with Ms. Davis?\n\nMs. Davis: Yes, this is Sarah Davis.\n\nSalesperson: Hi Ms. Davis, I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. I'm reaching out because I noticed your company recently expanded its operations, and I wanted to discuss how our cloud-based project management software could help streamline your processes. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n\nMs. Davis: I suppose I can spare a few minutes. What exactly does your software do?\n\nSalesperson: Thank you for your time, Ms. Davis.

Can you tell me a bit about how your team currently manages projects?\n\nMs. Davis: We're using a combination of spreadsheets and email right now. It works, but it's not ideal, especially with our recent growth.\n\nSalesperson: I see. Many of our clients were in a similar position before switching to CloudProject. What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve. Our platform provides a central hub where all team members can see task assignments, deadlines, and progress in real-time. How do you think that kind of visibility would impact your team's productivity?\n\nMs. Davis: It could certainly help reduce some of the confusion we're experiencing. How difficult is it to implement and train staff on using it?\n\nSalesperson: Great question. We pride ourselves on making the transition as smooth as possible. We offer a comprehensive onboarding process, including personalized training sessions for your team. Most of our clients find that their teams are up and running comfortably within a week. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how CloudProject works?\n\nMs. Davis: A demo could be helpful. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I'd be happy to set that up for you.

I noticed you weren't investing in social media marketing and wanted to ask you a few questions about why you've decided to stray away from this type of marketing and learn more about what you do and your challenges in reaching customers. Is now a good time to talk?\n\nMr. Thompson: Hi Alex. I have a few minutes now, I suppose.\n\nSalesperson: Great, thank you. First, could you tell me a bit about your business? What products or services do you offer?\n\nMr. Thompson: We're a local bakery specializing in artisanal breads and pastries.\n\nSalesperson: That sounds delicious! How long have you been in business?\n\nMr. Thompson: We've been around for about 10 years now.\n\nSalesperson: Congratulations on a decade of success! That's quite an achievement. Can you tell me about your current marketing efforts? How are you typically reaching your customers?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, we mostly rely on word of mouth and some local print ads. We have a website, but it's pretty basic.\n\nSalesperson: I see. And how has that been working for you? Are you seeing the growth you'd like?\n\nMr. Thompson: It's been okay, but we've plateaued a bit lately. We'd like to attract more younger customers.\n\nSalesperson: That's exactly where social media marketing could help. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook are perfect for showcasing beautiful photos of your baked goods and connecting with younger demographics. May I ask why you haven't explored social media marketing yet?\n\nMr. Thompson: Honestly, it just seems overwhelming. We're not very tech-savvy here, and we're always so busy with the day-to-day operations.\n\nSalesperson: I completely understand. Many of our clients felt the same way before working with us. That's where we come in - we can handle all aspects of your social media presence, from setting up accounts to creating content and engaging with your audience. Would you be interested in hearing about how we've helped other local businesses like yours increase their customer base through social media?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to learn more.\n\nSalesperson: Great! Let me give you a quick example. We worked with a local coffee shop last year, and within six months of implementing a social media strategy, they saw a 30% increase in foot traffic, primarily from the under-35 demographic. We could potentially achieve similar results for your bakery. Would you like to schedule a free consultation where we can do a deep dive into your business goals and how we might be able to help you achieve them?\n\nMr. Thompson: That does sound interesting. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I have some availability next week. How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound? We could do it via video call or in person at your bakery, whichever you prefer.\n\nMr. Thompson: Tuesday at 10 works. Let's do it at the bakery.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect! I'm looking forward to meeting you and seeing your bakery. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?\n\nMr. Thompson: Not right now, thanks.\n\nSalesperson: Alright, thank you for your time today, Mr. Thompson. I'll send you a calendar invite for Tuesday at 10 AM. Have a great day, and I'm excited to help your bakery reach new customers!"""

Their system revolutionizes the traditional ride-along process by leveraging technology to create a more efficient and scalable coaching method.\n\n  At the core of Rilla's service is an audio recording system that captures sales conversations during customer visits or service calls. These recordings are then transcribed into text format, providing a written record of each interaction. Rilla's AI technology analyzes these transcripts and conversations, extracting valuable insights and generating concise summaries of each sales encounter.\n\n  The platform goes beyond mere transcription by offering robust analytics based on the recorded conversations. This data-driven approach allows sales managers to gain a comprehensive understanding of their team's performance and identify areas for improvement.

"1724546758903-1951","""Sebastian: Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

Are you seeing the growth you'd like?\n\nMr. Thompson: It's been okay, but we've plateaued a bit lately.

It works, but it's not ideal, especially with our recent growth.\n\nSalesperson: I see. Many of our clients were in a similar position before switching to CloudProject. What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve. Our platform provides a central hub where all team members can see task assignments, deadlines, and progress in real-time. How do you think that kind of visibility would impact your team's productivity?\n\nMs. Davis: It could certainly help reduce some of the confusion we're experiencing. How difficult is it to implement and train staff on using it?\n\nSalesperson: Great question. We pride ourselves on making the transition as smooth as possible. We offer a comprehensive onboarding process, including personalized training sessions for your team. Most of our clients find that their teams are up and running comfortably within a week. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how CloudProject works?\n\nMs. Davis: A demo could be helpful. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I'd be happy to set that up for you.

What products or services do you offer?\n\nMr. Thompson: We're a local bakery specializing in artisanal breads and pastries.\n\nSalesperson: That sounds delicious! How long have you been in business?\n\nMr. Thompson: We've been around for about 10 years now.\n\nSalesperson: Congratulations on a decade of success! That's quite an achievement. Can you tell me about your current marketing efforts? How are you typically reaching your customers?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, we mostly rely on word of mouth and some local print ads. We have a website, but it's pretty basic.\n\nSalesperson: I see. And how has that been working for you? Are you seeing the growth you'd like?\n\nMr. Thompson: It's been okay, but we've plateaued a bit lately. We'd like to attract more younger customers.\n\nSalesperson: That's exactly where social media marketing could help. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook are perfect for showcasing beautiful photos of your baked goods and connecting with younger demographics. May I ask why you haven't explored social media marketing yet?\n\nMr. Thompson: Honestly, it just seems overwhelming. We're not very tech-savvy here, and we're always so busy with the day-to-day operations.\n\nSalesperson: I completely understand. Many of our clients felt the same way before working with us. That's where we come in - we can handle all aspects of your social media presence, from setting up accounts to creating content and engaging with your audience. Would you be interested in hearing about how we've helped other local businesses like yours increase their customer base through social media?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to learn more.\n\nSalesperson: Great! Let me give you a quick example. We worked with a local coffee shop last year, and within six months of implementing a social media strategy, they saw a 30% increase in foot traffic, primarily from the under-35 demographic. We could potentially achieve similar results for your bakery. Would you like to schedule a free consultation where we can do a deep dive into your business goals and how we might be able to help you achieve them?\n\nMr. Thompson: That does sound interesting. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I have some availability next week. How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound? We could do it via video call or in person at your bakery, whichever you prefer.\n\nMr. Thompson: Tuesday at 10 works. Let's do it at the bakery.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect!

"1724545508608-7171","""Sebastian introduces himself as the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice, a company that provides speech analytics for outside sales and service. Their focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. The process involves using a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n  \n  Sebastian explains that the idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where they worked with major brands. They realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n  \n  Using roofing sales as an example, Sebastian describes how their analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n  \n  Another crucial insight from their analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales."""

What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve.

"1724546813760-794","""Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""
"1724553819111-2957","""Michael is one of the founders of a company called Rela, where he serves as the Chief AI Officer. Rela provides speech analytics for outside sales, analyzing conversations to help sales reps sell more effectively. Michael got into AI somewhat unexpectedly - he was originally studying electrical engineering in college but was struggling academically. After watching the TV show Westworld, he became fascinated with AI and started teaching himself Python and machine learning concepts through online resources.\n\nAs a senior in college, Michael created a music recommendation system that used AI to analyze the actual content of songs, rather than just collaborative filtering. He entered this project into competitions and hackathons, which led to some exciting opportunities. At one event, he ended up presenting to high-profile judges like Jack Selby (PayPal co-founder) and even got connected with Apple Music executives.\n\nMichael emphasized that he had no formal training in AI or computer science. He learned through grinding - watching tutorials, implementing papers, and working on projects. When starting Rela, he spent two years solving the challenging problem of speaker diarization (determining who is speaking and when in an audio recording). Michael values creativity and out-of-the-box thinking when hiring, as the problems they tackle often have no existing solutions.\n\nThe video concluded with a demonstration of an AI-powered accountability coach that Headstarter is developing. It uses conversational AI to check in on users' job search progress, learning goals, and overall wellbeing. Michael was impressed by the speed and capabilities of the system, which the Headstarter team revealed is running on the newly released Llama 3 model."""

I noticed you weren't investing in social media marketing and wanted to ask you a few questions about why you've decided to stray away from this type of marketing and learn more about what you do and your challenges in reaching customers. Is now a good time to talk?\n\nMr. Thompson: Hi Alex. I have a few minutes now, I suppose.\n\nSalesperson: Great, thank you. First, could you tell me a bit about your business? What products or services do you offer?\n\nMr. Thompson: We're a local bakery specializing in artisanal breads and pastries.\n\nSalesperson: That sounds delicious! How long have you been in business?\n\nMr. Thompson: We've been around for about 10 years now.\n\nSalesperson: Congratulations on a decade of success! That's quite an achievement. Can you tell me about your current marketing efforts? How are you typically reaching your customers?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, we mostly rely on word of mouth and some local print ads. We have a website, but it's pretty basic.\n\nSalesperson: I see. And how has that been working for you? Are you seeing the growth you'd like?\n\nMr. Thompson: It's been okay, but we've plateaued a bit lately. We'd like to attract more younger customers.\n\nSalesperson: That's exactly where social media marketing could help. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook are perfect for showcasing beautiful photos of your baked goods and connecting with younger demographics. May I ask why you haven't explored social media marketing yet?\n\nMr. Thompson: Honestly, it just seems overwhelming. We're not very tech-savvy here, and we're always so busy with the day-to-day operations.\n\nSalesperson: I completely understand. Many of our clients felt the same way before working with us. That's where we come in - we can handle all aspects of your social media presence, from setting up accounts to creating content and engaging with your audience. Would you be interested in hearing about how we've helped other local businesses like yours increase their customer base through social media?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to learn more.\n\nSalesperson: Great! Let me give you a quick example. We worked with a local coffee shop last year, and within six months of implementing a social media strategy, they saw a 30% increase in foot traffic, primarily from the under-35 demographic. We could potentially achieve similar results for your bakery. Would you like to schedule a free consultation where we can do a deep dive into your business goals and how we might be able to help you achieve them?\n\nMr. Thompson: That does sound interesting. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I have some availability next week. How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound? We could do it via video call or in person at your bakery, whichever you prefer.\n\nMr. Thompson: Tuesday at 10 works. Let's do it at the bakery.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect! I'm looking forward to meeting you and seeing your bakery. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?\n\nMr. Thompson: Not right now, thanks.\n\nSalesperson: Alright, thank you for your time today, Mr. Thompson. I'll send you a calendar invite for Tuesday at 10 AM. Have a great day, and I'm excited to help your bakery reach new customers!"""

It works, but it's not ideal, especially with our recent growth.\n\nSalesperson: I see. Many of our clients were in a similar position before switching to CloudProject. What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve. Our platform provides a central hub where all team members can see task assignments, deadlines, and progress in real-time. How do you think that kind of visibility would impact your team's productivity?\n\nMs. Davis: It could certainly help reduce some of the confusion we're experiencing. How difficult is it to implement and train staff on using it?\n\nSalesperson: Great question. We pride ourselves on making the transition as smooth as possible. We offer a comprehensive onboarding process, including personalized training sessions for your team. Most of our clients find that their teams are up and running comfortably within a week. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how CloudProject works?\n\nMs. Davis: A demo could be helpful. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I'd be happy to set that up for you.

"1724548638959-1767","""Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

Rela provides speech analytics for outside sales, analyzing conversations to help sales reps sell more effectively. Michael got into AI somewhat unexpectedly - he was originally studying electrical engineering in college but was struggling academically. After watching the TV show Westworld, he became fascinated with AI and started teaching himself Python and machine learning concepts through online resources.\n\nAs a senior in college, Michael created a music recommendation system that used AI to analyze the actual content of songs, rather than just collaborative filtering. He entered this project into competitions and hackathons, which led to some exciting opportunities. At one event, he ended up presenting to high-profile judges like Jack Selby (PayPal co-founder) and even got connected with Apple Music executives.\n\nMichael emphasized that he had no formal training in AI or computer science. He learned through grinding - watching tutorials, implementing papers, and working on projects. When starting Rela, he spent two years solving the challenging problem of speaker diarization (determining who is speaking and when in an audio recording). Michael values creativity and out-of-the-box thinking when hiring, as the problems they tackle often have no existing solutions.\n\nThe video concluded with a demonstration of an AI-powered accountability coach that Headstarter is developing. It uses conversational AI to check in on users' job search progress, learning goals, and overall wellbeing. Michael was impressed by the speed and capabilities of the system, which the Headstarter team revealed is running on the newly released Llama 3 model."""

It works, but it's not ideal, especially with our recent growth.\n\nSalesperson: I see. Many of our clients were in a similar position before switching to CloudProject. What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve. Our platform provides a central hub where all team members can see task assignments, deadlines, and progress in real-time. How do you think that kind of visibility would impact your team's productivity?\n\nMs. Davis: It could certainly help reduce some of the confusion we're experiencing. How difficult is it to implement and train staff on using it?\n\nSalesperson: Great question. We pride ourselves on making the transition as smooth as possible. We offer a comprehensive onboarding process, including personalized training sessions for your team. Most of our clients find that their teams are up and running comfortably within a week. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how CloudProject works?\n\nMs. Davis: A demo could be helpful. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I'd be happy to set that up for you. I have some availability tomorrow afternoon or Friday morning. Which would work better for you?\n\nMs. Davis: Friday morning would be preferable.\n\nSalesperson: Excellent. How does 10 AM on Friday sound? I can send you a calendar invite with a link to our video conference platform.\n\nMs. Davis: 10 AM Friday works for me.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect, I'll send that invite right over. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions about CloudProject or our company?\n\nMs. Davis: Not at the moment, but I'm sure I'll have some during the demo.\n\nSalesperson: Of course. I'll make sure to leave plenty of time for questions during our session. Thank you so much for your time today, Ms. Davis. I'm looking forward to showing you how CloudProject can help streamline your operations on Friday.\n\nMs. Davis: Thank you, Emily. I'll see you then.\n\nSalesperson: Great, have a wonderful rest of your day!"""

"1724546787882-6670","""Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

"1724546809394-1129","""Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

I'm looking forward to showing you how CloudProject can help streamline your operations on Friday.\n\nMs. Davis: Thank you, Emily. I'll see you then.\n\nSalesperson: Great, have a wonderful rest of your day!"""
"1724554472066-785","""Salesperson: Good afternoon, this is Emily from CloudTech Solutions. Am I speaking with Ms. Davis?\n\nMs. Davis: Yes, this is Sarah Davis.\n\nSalesperson: Hi Ms. Davis, I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. I'm reaching out because I noticed your company recently expanded its operations, and I wanted to discuss how our cloud-based project management software could help streamline your processes. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n\nMs. Davis: I suppose I can spare a few minutes. What exactly does your software do?\n\nSalesperson: Thank you for your time, Ms. Davis. Our software, CloudProject, is designed to help businesses like yours manage complex projects more efficiently. It offers real-time collaboration, resource allocation, and progress tracking all in one platform. Can you tell me a bit about how your team currently manages projects?\n\nMs. Davis: We're using a combination of spreadsheets and email right now. It works, but it's not ideal, especially with our recent growth.\n\nSalesperson: I see. Many of our clients were in a similar position before switching to CloudProject. What would you say are the biggest challenges you're facing with your current system?\n\nMs. Davis: Well, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone on the same page. We're wasting time in meetings just trying to figure out who's doing what and what's been completed.\n\nSalesperson: That's a common issue, and it's exactly the kind of problem CloudProject is designed to solve. Our platform provides a central hub where all team members can see task assignments, deadlines, and progress in real-time. How do you think that kind of visibility would impact your team's productivity?\n\nMs. Davis: It could certainly help reduce some of the confusion we're experiencing. How difficult is it to implement and train staff on using it?\n\nSalesperson: Great question. We pride ourselves on making the transition as smooth as possible. We offer a comprehensive onboarding process, including personalized training sessions for your team. Most of our clients find that their teams are up and running comfortably within a week. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how CloudProject works?\n\nMs. Davis: A demo could be helpful. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I'd be happy to set that up for you. I have some availability tomorrow afternoon or Friday morning. Which would work better for you?\n\nMs. Davis: Friday morning would be preferable.\n\nSalesperson: Excellent. How does 10 AM on Friday sound? I can send you a calendar invite with a link to our video conference platform.\n\nMs. Davis: 10 AM Friday works for me.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect, I'll send that invite right over. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions about CloudProject or our company?\n\nMs. Davis: Not at the moment, but I'm sure I'll have some during the demo.\n\nSalesperson: Of course.

"1724554476179-8375","""Salesperson: Hi, Mr. Thompson. My name is Alex from Digital Boost Marketing. I noticed you weren't investing in social media marketing and wanted to ask you a few questions about why you've decided to stray away from this type of marketing and learn more about what you do and your challenges in reaching customers. Is now a good time to talk?\n\nMr. Thompson: Hi Alex. I have a few minutes now, I suppose.\n\nSalesperson: Great, thank you. First, could you tell me a bit about your business? What products or services do you offer?\n\nMr. Thompson: We're a local bakery specializing in artisanal breads and pastries.\n\nSalesperson: That sounds delicious! How long have you been in business?\n\nMr. Thompson: We've been around for about 10 years now.\n\nSalesperson: Congratulations on a decade of success! That's quite an achievement. Can you tell me about your current marketing efforts? How are you typically reaching your customers?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, we mostly rely on word of mouth and some local print ads. We have a website, but it's pretty basic.\n\nSalesperson: I see. And how has that been working for you? Are you seeing the growth you'd like?\n\nMr. Thompson: It's been okay, but we've plateaued a bit lately. We'd like to attract more younger customers.\n\nSalesperson: That's exactly where social media marketing could help. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook are perfect for showcasing beautiful photos of your baked goods and connecting with younger demographics. May I ask why you haven't explored social media marketing yet?\n\nMr. Thompson: Honestly, it just seems overwhelming. We're not very tech-savvy here, and we're always so busy with the day-to-day operations.\n\nSalesperson: I completely understand. Many of our clients felt the same way before working with us. That's where we come in - we can handle all aspects of your social media presence, from setting up accounts to creating content and engaging with your audience. Would you be interested in hearing about how we've helped other local businesses like yours increase their customer base through social media?\n\nMr. Thompson: Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to learn more.\n\nSalesperson: Great! Let me give you a quick example. We worked with a local coffee shop last year, and within six months of implementing a social media strategy, they saw a 30% increase in foot traffic, primarily from the under-35 demographic. We could potentially achieve similar results for your bakery. Would you like to schedule a free consultation where we can do a deep dive into your business goals and how we might be able to help you achieve them?\n\nMr. Thompson: That does sound interesting. When could we do that?\n\nSalesperson: I have some availability next week. How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound? We could do it via video call or in person at your bakery, whichever you prefer.\n\nMr. Thompson: Tuesday at 10 works. Let's do it at the bakery.\n\nSalesperson: Perfect! I'm looking forward to meeting you and seeing your bakery. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?\n\nMr. Thompson: Not right now, thanks.\n\nSalesperson: Alright, thank you for your time today, Mr. Thompson. I'll send you a calendar invite for Tuesday at 10 AM. Have a great day, and I'm excited to help your bakery reach new customers!"""

"1724546809387-3681","""Hi, I'm Sebastian, the founder and CEO of Rilla Voice. We provide speech analytics for outside sales and service. Our focus is on analyzing conversations of door-to-door representatives, roofing reps, solar reps, and anyone who speaks face-to-face with customers. We use a mobile app to record customer conversations, which are then analyzed using AI to help improve sales techniques.\n\nThe idea for Rilla Voice came from a previous startup where we worked with major brands. We realized that 85% of sales and commerce still happens offline, with limited visibility into these interactions. Understanding what people think by analyzing what they say became the foundation for Rilla Voice.\n\nLet me give you an example using roofing sales. Our analytics revealed key differences between top performers and newer reps. Top performers focused on specific pain points like missing shingles and debris in about 80% of their conversations. This approach made them three to four times more likely to book an appointment compared to newer reps who used different pitching strategies.\n\nAnother crucial insight from our analytics is the importance of the talk ratio - how much the salesperson talks versus the customer. For door-to-door conversations, the ideal talk ratio is around 75-85% for the salesperson. However, for inspections or adjuster meetings, the ratio should decrease to about 50-60%, emphasizing the importance of listening in sales.\n\nAt Rilla Voice, we're committed to providing these valuable insights into offline sales interactions, helping companies improve their sales strategies and performance. Our goal is to bring visibility and data-driven decision making to the world of face-to-face sales, which has been largely overlooked by technology until now."""

"1724553811993-4419","""Michael is one of the founders of a company called Rela, where he serves as the Chief AI Officer. Rela provides speech analytics for outside sales, analyzing conversations to help sales reps sell more effectively. Michael got into AI somewhat unexpectedly - he was originally studying electrical engineering in college but was struggling academically. After watching the TV show Westworld, he became fascinated with AI and started teaching himself Python and machine learning concepts through online resources.\n\nAs a senior in college, Michael created a music recommendation system that used AI to analyze the actual content of songs, rather than just collaborative filtering. He entered this project into competitions and hackathons, which led to some exciting opportunities. At one event, he ended up presenting to high-profile judges like Jack Selby (PayPal co-founder) and even got connected with Apple Music executives.\n\nMichael emphasized that he had no formal training in AI or computer science. He learned through grinding - watching tutorials, implementing papers, and working on projects. When starting Rela, he spent two years solving the challenging problem of speaker diarization (determining who is speaking and when in an audio recording). Michael values creativity and out-of-the-box thinking when hiring, as the problems they tackle often have no existing solutions.\n\nThe video concluded with a demonstration of an AI-powered accountability coach that Headstarter is developing. It uses conversational AI to check in on users' job search progress, learning goals, and overall wellbeing. Michael was impressed by the speed and capabilities of the system, which the Headstarter team revealed is running on the newly released Llama 3 model."""
