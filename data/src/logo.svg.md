### SVG file for a React logo
This SVG file defines the graphical representation of the React logo. It uses scalable vector graphics (SVG) to create a visually appealing and resolution-independent image. The logo consists of a central circle surrounded by three ellipses, all filled with a specific shade of blue (#61DAFB). The ellipses are arranged symmetrically around the circle, creating a dynamic and recognizable design. The SVG format ensures that the logo can be scaled to any size without losing quality, making it suitable for various applications, from web pages to print materials. The file does not rely on any external dependencies, ensuring ease of use and integration.
