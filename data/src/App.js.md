## [App.js](App.js)

### A React component for posting a sales call transcript to an API and displaying the response.

This React component, `App`, is designed to post a predefined sales call transcript to an external API and display the response. It utilizes React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects. The component maintains three pieces of state: `response` for storing the API response, `error` for capturing any errors during the API call, and `loading` to indicate the loading state.

Upon mounting, the component automatically posts the transcript to the specified API endpoint using the `postTranscript` function. This function handles the API call, manages the loading state, and updates the `response` or `error` state based on the outcome. The transcript is displayed in a formatted manner within the component, and a button is provided to manually trigger the API call again if needed.

The UI includes a title, the formatted transcript, a button to post the transcript, and conditional rendering for loading, error, and response states. The button is disabled while the API call is in progress to prevent multiple submissions. The component ensures a user-friendly experience by providing clear feedback on the status of the API call and any errors that occur.
