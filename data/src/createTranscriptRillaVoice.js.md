### React component for posting and displaying a transcript

This code defines a React component that posts a predefined transcript to a server and displays the response. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. Upon mounting, it automatically sends a POST request containing the transcript text to a specified API endpoint. The component handles loading states, errors, and displays the server response. It also provides a button to manually trigger the POST request. The UI includes sections for the transcript text, loading indicators, error messages, and the server response, all styled with inline CSS. This setup is useful for applications that need to process and display server responses based on user interactions or automated triggers.
