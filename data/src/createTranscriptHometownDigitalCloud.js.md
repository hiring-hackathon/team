### React component for posting sales transcripts to an API

This code defines a React component that allows users to select and post predefined sales transcripts to an API endpoint. The component maintains state variables for the selected transcript, API response, loading status, and any errors encountered during the process. It uses the `useEffect` hook to automatically post the selected transcript when it changes. The user interface includes a dropdown menu for selecting a transcript, a button to manually post the transcript, and sections to display the selected transcript, API response, and any errors. The component handles API interactions using the `fetch` function, and updates the UI based on the API response or any errors that occur.
