### Styles for a React application with a centered layout and animated logo

The `App.css` file provides styling for a React application, focusing on a centered layout and an animated logo. The `.App` class centers the text within the application. The `.App-logo` class sets the logo's height and disables pointer events. Additionally, it includes a media query to apply a spinning animation to the logo when the user does not prefer reduced motion. The `.App-header` class styles the header with a dark background, full viewport height, and centers its content both vertically and horizontally. It also adjusts the font size responsively and sets the text color to white. The `.App-link` class styles links with a specific shade of blue. Finally, the `@keyframes App-logo-spin` defines the spinning animation for the logo, rotating it 360 degrees continuously.
