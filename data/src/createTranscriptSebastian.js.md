### React component for posting and displaying a transcript analysis

This code defines a React component that posts a predefined transcript to an API endpoint and displays the resulting analysis. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It initializes three state variables: `response` for storing the API response, `error` for capturing any errors, and `loading` to indicate the loading state. The `postTranscript` function sends a POST request with the transcript text to a specified API endpoint. If the request is successful, the response data is stored in the `response` state; otherwise, an error message is captured. The `useEffect` hook triggers the `postTranscript` function when the component mounts. The component renders a title, a loading message while the request is in progress, the API response if available, and any error messages. Additionally, a button is provided to manually trigger the transcript analysis.
