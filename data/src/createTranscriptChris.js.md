### React component for posting and displaying a transcript

This code defines a React component that posts a predefined transcript to a server and displays the response. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It initializes with a transcript text about Chris's journey and Rilla Voice. Upon mounting, it automatically posts the transcript to a specified API endpoint using the `fetch` function. The component handles loading states, errors, and displays the server's response. Users can also manually trigger the posting by clicking a button. The UI includes styled sections for the transcript, a button for posting, and conditional rendering for loading, error, and response states.
