### React component for posting and displaying a sales call transcript

This code defines a React component named `TranscriptAnalysis` that handles the posting and displaying of a sales call transcript. The component uses React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects. It initializes three pieces of state: `response`, `error`, and `loading` to handle the API response, any errors, and the loading state, respectively.

The transcript of a conversation between a salesperson named Sarah from Hometown Realty and a potential client, Mrs. Johnson, is hardcoded as a string. The `postTranscript` function sends this transcript to a specified API endpoint using a POST request. The function updates the state based on the success or failure of the request, displaying appropriate messages or errors.

The `useEffect` hook ensures that the `postTranscript` function is called once when the component mounts. The component's UI includes a button to manually trigger the `postTranscript` function, a section to display the transcript, and conditional rendering to show loading status, errors, and the API response. The styling is inline and aims to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.
