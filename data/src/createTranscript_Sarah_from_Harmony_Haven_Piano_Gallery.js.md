### React component for posting a piano gallery transcript to an API

This code defines a React component that automates the process of posting a predefined transcript of a conversation at the Harmony Haven Piano Gallery to an external API. The component utilizes React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects. 

Upon mounting, the component triggers an asynchronous function `postTranscript` that sends the transcript text to a specified API endpoint using a POST request. The function handles loading states and potential errors, updating the component's state accordingly. The transcript text is displayed on the page, and users can manually trigger the `postTranscript` function by clicking a button. The component also displays the API response or any errors encountered during the request. 

This setup provides a user-friendly interface for posting and viewing the transcript and its associated API response, making it suitable for applications requiring speech analytics or similar functionalities.
