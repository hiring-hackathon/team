### A React component that posts a transcript to an API and displays the response.

This code defines a React component that automates the process of posting a predefined transcript to an API endpoint and displaying the response. The component uses React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects. Initially, the component sets up state variables for handling the API response, errors, and loading status.

Upon mounting, the component triggers the `postTranscript` function, which sends a POST request to a specified API endpoint with the transcript text in JSON format. The function handles potential errors and updates the state accordingly. The component also includes a button to manually trigger the transcript posting, with visual feedback for loading and error states.

The UI consists of a title, the transcript text displayed in paragraphs, a button to post the transcript, and sections to show loading status, errors, and the API response. The component ensures a user-friendly experience by disabling the button during loading and providing clear error messages.
