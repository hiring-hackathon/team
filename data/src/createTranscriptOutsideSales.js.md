### React component for posting and analyzing a sales transcript

This code defines a React component that posts a predefined sales transcript to an API for analysis and displays the results. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It initializes with three state variables: `response`, `error`, and `loading`. The `transcriptText` variable contains a hardcoded transcript of a sales pitch.

The `postTranscript` function is an asynchronous function that sends a POST request to a specified API endpoint with the transcript text in JSON format. It handles loading states, errors, and updates the response state with the data received from the API. If the request fails, it sets an error message.

The `useEffect` hook triggers the `postTranscript` function once when the component mounts, ensuring the transcript is analyzed as soon as the component loads.

The component renders a user interface that includes:
- A header with the title "Rilla Voice: Speech Analytics for Outside Sales".
- A section displaying the transcript text.
- A button to manually trigger the transcript analysis, which is disabled and shows a loading state while the request is in progress.
- Conditional rendering for loading messages, error messages, and the analysis results.

The styling is inline and ensures the component is visually organized and user-friendly.
