### A React component for posting and displaying a real estate sales transcript

This code defines a React component that simulates the process of posting a real estate sales transcript to an API and displaying the response. The component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It initializes three state variables: `response`, `error`, and `loading`, which are used to handle the API response, errors, and loading state, respectively.

The transcript text is hardcoded within the component and represents a conversation between a salesperson and a potential client. The `postTranscript` function is an asynchronous function that sends a POST request to a specified API endpoint with the transcript text in the request body. It handles the API response, sets the response data to the state, and manages any errors that occur during the request.

The `useEffect` hook is used to automatically post the transcript when the component mounts. The component renders a user interface that includes the transcript text, a button to manually post the transcript, and conditional rendering for loading states, errors, and the API response. The button is disabled while the transcript is being posted to prevent multiple submissions.

Overall, this component demonstrates how to handle API requests, manage state, and render conditional content in a React application. It is designed to be a part of a larger application that deals with speech analytics for outside sales.
