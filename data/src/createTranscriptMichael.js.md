### React component for posting a transcript to an API and displaying the response

This React component, `App`, is designed to post a predefined transcript to an API endpoint and display the response. It uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. The component initializes with three state variables: `response`, `error`, and `loading`, which track the API response, any errors, and the loading state, respectively.

Upon mounting, the `useEffect` hook triggers the `postTranscript` function, which sends a POST request containing the transcript text to a specified API endpoint. The function handles the request asynchronously, updating the state based on the success or failure of the request. If the request is successful, the response data is stored in the `response` state; otherwise, an error message is set in the `error` state.

The component renders a user interface that includes the transcript text, a button to manually trigger the `postTranscript` function, and conditional elements to display loading indicators, error messages, and the API response. The button is disabled while the request is in progress to prevent multiple submissions. The UI is styled with inline CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly presentation.
