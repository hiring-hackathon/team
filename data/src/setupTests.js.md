### Brief 20-word summary
Initializes custom Jest matchers for DOM node assertions using the @testing-library/jest-dom library.

This setupTests.js file is used to configure Jest, a popular testing framework, to include custom matchers provided by the @testing-library/jest-dom library. By importing '@testing-library/jest-dom', it extends Jest's built-in matchers to include additional DOM-related assertions. This allows developers to write more expressive and readable tests for their React components. For example, you can use matchers like `toHaveTextContent` to assert that a DOM element contains specific text. This setup is particularly useful for improving the clarity and maintainability of your test suite, making it easier to verify the behavior of your user interface.
