## [reportWebVitals.js](reportWebVitals.js)

### Utility to measure and report web performance metrics

The `reportWebVitals.js` file defines a function named `reportWebVitals` that is designed to measure and report key web performance metrics. This function takes a single argument, `onPerfEntry`, which is expected to be a callback function. If `onPerfEntry` is provided and is a function, the code dynamically imports the `web-vitals` library. Once the library is loaded, it retrieves several performance measurement functions: `getCLS`, `getFID`, `getFCP`, `getLCP`, and `getTTFB`. These functions correspond to various web performance metrics: Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), First Input Delay (FID), First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Time to First Byte (TTFB). Each of these functions is then called with `onPerfEntry` as an argument, allowing the provided callback to handle the performance entries as they are recorded. This setup is useful for monitoring and analyzing the performance of web applications in real-time.
