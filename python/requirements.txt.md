## [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

### Dependency management for OpenAI, Pinecone, and environment variables

The `requirements.txt` file specifies the dependencies required for the project to function correctly. It lists three essential Python packages:

1. **openai==1.42.0**: This package is the official OpenAI API client, which allows the project to interact with OpenAI's models and services. It is crucial for any functionality related to natural language processing or other AI-driven tasks provided by OpenAI.

2. **pinecone==5.0.1**: Pinecone is a vector database service that enables efficient similarity search and retrieval of high-dimensional data. This package is used to integrate Pinecone's capabilities into the project, facilitating tasks such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and other applications requiring fast and scalable vector operations.

3. **python-dotenv==1.0.1**: This package is used to manage environment variables. It allows the project to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring that sensitive information such as API keys and configuration settings are kept secure and easily configurable.

By listing these dependencies in `requirements.txt`, the project ensures that all necessary packages are installed with their specified versions, providing a consistent development environment and reducing potential compatibility issues. This setup is particularly useful for onboarding new team members, as they can quickly install all required dependencies using a single command.
