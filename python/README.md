Using Python, I've created a script, `export-from-pinecone-hackathon.py`, to export data from our Pinecone vector database. This script:

1. Connects to our Pinecone index named "hackathon".
2. Retrieves all vector IDs from the index, specifically from the "ns1" namespace.
3. For each retrieved ID, it fetches the corresponding 1536-dimensional vector and its associated metadata.
4. Exports all this data - including vector values and metadata - into a JSON file named `hackathon_export.json`.

The script is designed to handle a large number of vectors, using multiple query attempts to ensure comprehensive data retrieval. It also includes error handling and logging for better troubleshooting.

Now that I have this export from Pinecone (alongside our previously exported DynamoDB data) committed to Git, I'm ready to proceed with transcript regeneration. Having these exports versioned in Git provides a safety net, allowing for easier rollback if issues arise during the regeneration process.

Given that both Pinecone and DynamoDB contain live production data, I'm approaching the transcript regeneration task with extra caution to maintain data integrity and system stability.
